We are a value driven blog dedicated to the AWARENESS, EDUCATION, RESPONSE, and OUTCOME on surveillance capitalism. Join the AERO community and become part of the solution.

### Awareness

We can't solve a problem as a community if we are unaware of the problem to begin with. We won't solve a problem if the problem is not a priority. It starts with you. As you become more and more aware, then it's time you begin to share. Your awareness is part of the solution.

### Education

Being aware is the first step, but it is knowledge through educating ourselves that leads us to the truth. With truth comes a clarity of the problem. Each one should teach one. In the words of Malcom X, "Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."

### Response

Together we stand, but divided we fall. Empowering ourselves with knowledge allows us to respond to the threat at hand. You are crucial. You have ideas. You are smart. Withholding contribution to society makes us dead. Choose to join the response, contribute to the solution. 

### Overcome

Become aware and share that awareness. Educate yourself and empower others. Choose to respond and inspire response. It starts with you, but it takes a village. As we take more and more action as individuals and as a community, we will surely overcome the problem.
