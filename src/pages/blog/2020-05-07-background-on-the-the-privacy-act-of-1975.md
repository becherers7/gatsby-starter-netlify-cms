According to government docs the Act was passed in "great haste during the last week of the 93rd Congress. No conference committee was convened to reconcile differences in the bills passed by the House and Senate." 

It is alarming and refreshing that justice.gov acknowledges that 1. The Act is very ambiguous and thus difficult to interpret in legal cases. And 2. Part of the reason for this is because that the proper time was not taken to create this Act.

The next part of this was that the Act established the “U.S. Privacy Protection Study Commission” to evaluate the statute and to issue a report containing recommendations for its improvement. This committee operation ended in 1977.

Privacy Act requires "the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to:  (1) “develop and, after notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in implementing” the Act; and (2) “provide continuing assistance to and oversight of the implementation” of the Act by agencies." Essentially OMB set guidelines to follow for the Privacy Act.

What is interesting to note is that a few courts have *rejected* these guidelines as not aligning with the spirit of the Act. To summarize all this the Act of 1975 has ambiguous wording allowing for gray areas and manipulation with supplementary guidelines that are not universally accepted.

Next we'll cover some different points of the the Act.
