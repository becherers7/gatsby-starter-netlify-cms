We are simply asked to be tracked and are expected to say yes. 

This is exemplified through giving ownership away every time we absent-mindedly agree to be tracked by a cookie, agreeing with a terms of service, or a data privacy policy. 

We are both numb and complacently accepting because if we don't agree, then we can't use tools and resources we rely on for every day online existence. It's very much an ultimatum to not use or be used.

The internet is supposed to be a free tool for access to information. As often with anything that claims to be "free", there is a cost. What will be the cost for allowing our lives to be tracked and monitored? 

I am not suggesting that we go off the grid, but I ask this question as a means to propose that we are in need of a different online business model standard. One that does not try to stalk and control us.
