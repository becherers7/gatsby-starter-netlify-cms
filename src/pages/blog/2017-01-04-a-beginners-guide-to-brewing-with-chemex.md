Privacy policies and terms of service are devolved both morally and democratically.  Our rights to information ownership have been restructured to be at the mercy of our digital masters. Personal data is not controlled at the citizen level but by corporations seeking to predict our behavior.

## Contracts are now paperless.

Contracts such as terms of service used to have a higher cost. One of the most important of these costs is the opportunity cost of reading through a large contract. Now that contracts are paperless, we simply have a checkbox and an encouraging green button to confirm we "read" through and agree to online terms. 

Why would we both to read them? In 2008 two professors at Carnegie Mellon calculated that reasonable reading of all the privacy policies that one encounters in a year would require 76 full business days with a *national* opportunity cost of $781 billion. This was just in 2008, it is way higher now. 

These digital documents are easily changeable and at a moments notice. Companies can easily extract additional beneficial data from consumers completely unrelated to the product the user signed up for. At this point you might want to know specific examples of data collected. Below are just a few examples.

1. Your photos may be for sale.
2. Your data can be given to law enforcement without consent.
3. You could be banned from filing class action law suits.
4. Even if you delete content the company may hold on to it.
5. You might not ever be able to delete an account you create.

Being given an ultimatum is unfair in a digital world where we claim "free" access to information.  This issue is not black and white. The problem here is that there is no dialogue what so ever between company and consumer. Nothing that allows us to barter or decide how much data we'll give in exchange for product use. We are walked all over.
