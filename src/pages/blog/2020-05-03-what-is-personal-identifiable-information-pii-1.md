description: While law review is typically a dry subject, knowledge of what is
  lawful for Personal Identifiable Information helps to not just identify and
  avoid misuse of our personal information, but also to understand what our
  current legal system lacks and needs. We will split this topic into multiple
  articles.

Currently there are no *central* federal level privacy laws in the US. An example of a central federal level privacy law is EU's GDPR. Instead we have several *vertically* focused federal laws.

What we mean by a central federal policy is an all encompassing federal level data policy. Where as with vertically focused federal laws, we have top down (national level to state level) policies for different vectors (such as finance, health, etc.).

We have 4 vertical policy federal laws here in the US. 

1. The US Privacy Act of 1974: The rights and restrictions on data held by government agencies.
2. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA): Protects financial non-public personal information.
3. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): Healthcare and health insurance personal data protection.
4. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): Protects the personal information of those 12 and younger.

Something important to note is that the GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data. The US laws currently implemented seek to protect our personal information but there is nothing that gives us *ownership* of our data. 

In the next section we will take a look at what protects us in the US Privacy Act of 1974.

To spin this, at a consumer level, for the every day person, there is nothing that gives us power over our every day digital lives. We are simply asked to be tracked and are expected to say yes.

This is exemplified through giving ownership away every time we absent-mindedly agree to be tracked by a cookie, agreeing with a terms of service, or a data privacy policy. 

We are both numb and complacently accepting because if we don't agree, then we can't use tools and resources we rely on for every day online existence. 

The internet is supposed to be a free tool for access to information. As often with anything that claims to be "free", there is a cost. What will be the cost for allowing our lives to be tracked and monitored? 

I am not suggesting that we go off the grid, but I ask this question as a means to propose that we are in need of a different online business model standard. One that does not try to stalk and control us.
