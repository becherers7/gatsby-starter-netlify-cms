In the pursuit of data privacy we are increasingly becoming aware that, "If it's free, then we are the product."

This is not accurate. After reading ***The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism*** by Shoshana Zuboff, I have realized that big data companies make us the *source* of a product in the form of commercialized personal information. 

An outrageous comparison is to that of slavery. One of the biggest evils of history used slaves as free labor to increase* **production*** of a good for the profit of the slave owner.

Data driven companies collect our free activity in the form of data to increase* **prediction*** of behavior. This data is commercialized in what is called, ***surveillance capitalism***. There is power in personal data. Predict someone's behavior, and you can anticipate an outcome. 

What is scary about this is that it leads not just to manipulated behavior, but to a potential attack on our freedom. We are not only being robbed of our personal data, we are being influenced and controlled. Don't believe it? Read this post for evidence based examples.

A though provoking comparison can also be made to the negative effects of the industrial revolution. Unprecedented productivity through industrial capitalism has depleted our planet's natural resources, endangering Earth. We are now fighting an uphill battle through green initiatives.

What will be the damaging long term effects of surveillance capitalism that obsessively improves the anticipation of our actions? How will surveillance capitalism impact our abilities to make rational and free choices? Will we become  such automated sources of behavioral data that we are steered into decisions we never made for ourselves? 

We need to arm and empower ourselves with knowledge about what is happening.
